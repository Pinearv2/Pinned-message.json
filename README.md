This repository is used internally to manage the pinned announcement and news content displayed on the launcher homepage.
The launcher reads a simple JSON file on startup and displays the message to users. This setup allows the team to update maintenance notices, warnings, or announcements without rebuilding or redistributing the launcher.
This repository is not intended for external use.
