This repository is used internally to manage the pinned announcement message shown on the launcher homepage.
The launcher reads a simple JSON file on startup and displays the message to users. This setup lets the team update maintenance notices, warnings, or announcements without rebuilding or redistributing the launcher.
This repository is not intended for external use.
